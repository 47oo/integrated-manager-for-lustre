Chroma internals
================

This is documentation internal to the Chroma engineering team, mostly generated from docstrings
in the code.

If you're new to the code, start here: :doc:`toplevel`.

Public service announcements:
 - If you're reading this, you are a developer, and therefore you have the power to fix things.
   If something in this document doesn't make sense or doesn't reflect the latest code, fix it.  If
   you can't fix it, ask someone else.  But you're not allowed to silently ignore problems.
 - The level of detail in the internals docs should be enough to be helpful, but not so much that
   it's a pain to keep it in sync with the code.  There is such a thing as too much documentation.
