<p>Volumes (also called LUNs or block devices) are the underlying units of storage used to create Lustre file systems.  Each Lustre target corresponds to a single volume. If servers in the volume have been configured for high availability, primary and secondary servers can be designated for a Lustre target. Only volumes that are not already in use as Lustre targets or local file systems are shown. A volume may be accessible on one or more servers via different device nodes, and it may be accessible via multiple device nodes on the same host.</p>
