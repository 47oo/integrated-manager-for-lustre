create a local_settings.py like this:

AWS_KEY_ID='' # From your 'security credentials -> access keys' page
AWS_SECRET='' # From your 'security credentials -> access keys' page
AWS_SSH_KEY = 'jcs-aws-key' # An AWS keypair name
AWS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY = '/Users/jcspray/ec2/jcs-aws-key.pem' # a local path

create a virtualenv and do a pip install -r requirements.txt

run ./manage.py syncdb --migrate --noinput

Create AMIs from the manager and storage instances.  Each of these
will take several minutes.

 ./manage.py create_manager_image
 ./manage.py create_storage_image

make sure you have the required two security groups in your AWS account:
chroma-manager (ports 22, 80, 514)
chroma-appliance  (port 22, 988)

./manage.py create_fs
 (create one manager, one appliance, and add the appliance to the manager)
./manage.py instances list
 (get a list of your instances with their local IDs)
./manage.py create_fs recover <local id>
 (when some instances have been created, try to set them up again e.g. if something
went wrong and you've fixed it now)
./manage.py instances terminate all
 (remove all the locally-known instances, i.e. those created with director)
./manage.py create_fs recover <local id>
 (open an ssh session to a ChromaManager by its local ID)

./manage.py nodes
   list all instances by local ids
./manage.py nodes ssh <id>
   open ssh connection to instance
./manage.py nodes terminate <id>
   destroy specified instance and all attached storage
./manage.py nodes terminate all
   you die, she dies, everybody dies
./manage.py new_image <id> <name>
   create AMI based on the specified instance
