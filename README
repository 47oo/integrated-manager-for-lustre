create a local_settings.py like this:

AWS_KEY_ID='' # From your 'security credentials -> access keys' page
AWS_SECRET='' # From your 'security credentials -> access keys' page
AWS_SSH_KEY = 'jcs-aws-key' # An AWS keypair name
AWS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY = '/Users/jcspray/ec2/jcs-aws-key.pem' # a local path

create a virtualenv and do a pip -r requirements.txt

run ./manage.py syncdb --migrate --noinput

make sure you have the required two security groups in your AWS account:
chroma-manager (ports 22, 80, 514)
chroma-appliance  (port 22)

./manage.py create_fs
 (create one manager, one appliance, and add the appliance to the manager)
./manage.py instances list
 (get a list of your instances with their local IDs)
./manage.py create_fs recover <local id>
 (when some instances have been created, try to set them up again e.g. if something
went wrong and you've fixed it now)
./manage.py instances terminate all
 (remove all the locally-known instances, i.e. those created with director)
./manage.py create_fs recover <local id>
 (open an ssh session to a ChromaManager by its local ID)
./manage.py issh <manager|appliance> <ec2 id>
 (open an SSH session to EC2 instance by its EC2 ID)
